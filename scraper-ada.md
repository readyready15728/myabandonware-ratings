# ratings-ada.py
## A scraper to extract ratings information from ADA Untergrund

This one is really simple. Just run `ratings-ada.py` and the CSV output will
soon appear on standard output. `run-ada.sh` takes care of this just as well
and places the single ratings file in `output/ada`. I recommend sorting by
year in ascending order, then by average vote in descending order. The other
fields aren't as important.
