# Ratings Scrapers

Scrapers for ratings on various websites whose search and sorting tools are
inadequate for me. Check out the Markdown file for each!

All scrapers are dependent on Python 2.x modules unicodecsv, requests and
BeautifulSoup.

Additionally, pregenerated ratings are now included in `ratings.zip`. I don't
intend to update them frequently though.
